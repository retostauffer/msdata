#' Item Assets
#'
#' Each item (i.e., each station) can provide multiple assets.
#' An asset specifies the type of data (e.g., historical, recent)
#' as well as the temporal resolution of the data and the data
#' period (if suitable). The `ms_assets` class is used to handle
#' these assets within the package.
